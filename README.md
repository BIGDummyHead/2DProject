# 2DProject

A simple 2D Project I am slowly adding onto to learn more about C++.

Currently this engine has the ability to:
* Render textures
* Animate textures
* Add conditions to animations
* Create GameObjects that are completely modular in design (similar to Unity)
* Add Text to screen
* Interaction with UI Objects and callbacks
* Raycasting
* Static Lighting
* Raycasted Lighting
* Audio (WASAPI Implementation)
* Input Detection for keys and mouse buttons (Down, Held, Release) event callbacks
* Cameras
* Collision and Collider detections via AABB
* Collision physics (moving objects around)
* Proper rendering (no overdrawing)
* And other cool things...
